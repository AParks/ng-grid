A simple one from the angular-seed project is included:\r\n\r\n    > ./scripts/web-server.js\r\n\r\n### Automated testing and building\r\n\r\nRunning this task will automatically rebuild `build/ng-grid.debug.js` when source files change, and run unit tests when `build/ng-grid.debug.js` or unit test files change. Youc an use this for testing during development.\r\n\r\n    # Run this in its own window\r\n    > grunt testwatch\r\n\r\n### Integration testing\r\n\r\nThere is a task for CI testing with PhantomJS\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the PHANTOMJS_BIN environment variable  is set properly\r\n2. PhantomJS with the singleRun option doesn't appear to function properly in Windows. The tests will run but PhantomJS will not automatically close.\r\n3. This task first builds the debug version of the source files and does not clean them up. If you run it you will have uncommitted changes in your working directory that you probably want to lose. `git checkout build` to lose them.\r\n\r\n    > grunt test-ci\r\n\r\n### Selecting browsers\r\n\r\nAll the test tasks accept a `--browsers` command line option that will be passed to karma.\r\n    \r\n    # Automatically re-run tests in both Chrome and FF.\r\n    grunt testwatch --browsers=Chrome,Firefox\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
